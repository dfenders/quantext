# Quantext

## FAQs

* ## Question number format
For question numbers which include decimal points or other characters e.g. ii) or (5b) or 3.1.2, for now, just make sure the Excel column format is specified as ‘text’ rather than ‘general' or ‘number’. If the question number is an integer then it will be fine. We have limited type checking at present (i.e. checking whether the contents of a cell is an integer, floating point number, character etc..) - it is on our to do list!

* ## Previously uploaded files disappeared
In order to apply updates to Quantext, from time to time, we need to clear the pilot database. If you find previously uploaded files have disappeared when you login you will need to upload files again. We recommend you note any settings used and especially save any analysis (as an Excel file) that you have added categories too in case this occurs. We will try to warn all pilot participants before a database reset is required but to be on the safe side, save your work.

* ## More than one person requires access to a Quantext Analysis 
For now, we recommend setting up a separate GMail account for use with Quantext and share the username and password among those who need access to the files. In future we hope to add permissions settings so that Quantext analysis can be easily shared, for example among members of a teaching team.

* ## Responses longer than a few words are hard to read in spreadsheet view
The current interface is not ideal for responses that are longer than a few words. We are working on a solution for this issue. In the meantime, we recommend hiding spreadsheet columns that are non-essential - you can do this from the settings associated with readability indices - and also restricting the number of responses to display to a small number e.g. 1 or 10.
