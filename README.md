###Question Number Format
For question numbers which include decimal points or other characters e.g. ii) or (5b) or 3.1.2, for now, just make sure the Excel column format is specified as ‘text’ rather than ‘general' or ‘number’. If the question number is an integer then it will be fine. We have limited type checking at present (i.e. checking whether the contents of a cell is an integer, floating point number, character etc..) - it is on our to do list!
